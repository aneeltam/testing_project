> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
I enjoyed testing GitLab. I have used it before at work, but there all of the materials have been created already and I just edit them, so it was nice to get to start from scratch. I definitely got a better understanding of what Webapp testing consists of when writing a test and bug report.      

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I wrote the test cases by cutting down the functions into smaller pieces. I used the provided structure from the teacher to document my findings. As I went step by step forwards in the testing process, I documented my steps along the way to the reports.    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
I have not done test case management before, but I would think a tool such as Jira could work for that purpose.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
I used Visual Studio Code to edit the files. I find it easy to use and keep the files organized. I had a split screen with GitLab taking up half of my screen and VSC taking up half, so I could simultaneously document my process as I was doing the steps.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
It took me a moment to first log into GitLab, as I had not used it on my personal computer before. It took a lot of steps to get verified to log in via GitHub, and the first time around it ended up in a glitch, and I had to redo all of the steps.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
I did not find any trouble using GitHub. I have used it in earlier courses. 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
I would consider using Selenium. I have heard it is not complex to use, and does not require a lot of coding experience to utilize.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
The most in-demand skills in software testing seem to be Java/Kotlin programming proficiency, expertise in Selenium and Appium for test automation, familiarity with Cucumber for behavior-driven development, experience with Jenkins and other continuous integration tools, SQL querying skills, and proficiency in Java and Python programming languages.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
I would focus on enhancing my technical skills in test automation, programming languages, and test management tools.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
The hands-on project helped me get a better grasp of testing concepts. It was a pleasant conclusion to the study unit. The videos in Percipio were challenging to follow, due to the fact that they did not provide any visual aids, making it hard to stay focused on the subject that was talked about. The related quizzes were difficult and required a lot of vocabulary and memorization of numerous concepts.
